### Coin price comparison over two coin exchanges

This web applet is made using React and Axios.

If we have node installed: 

1. clone repo
2. enter repo directory
3. npm start

It will run locally.


Answers to questionnaire:

1. There are some usability aspects that were sub-optimal, such as the overall design made simple, the lack of links to the exchanges so that one can go buy either BTC or ETH, and the sizing of content on different screens. There is also the fact that Gemini does not differntiate buy or sell price so I used the one available price for both. 
2. There is no part that seems to be overdesigned.
3. There would have to be no changes to the solution since I am using two public APIs, this is something that I considered when looking for API choices.
4. I would have made significant changes to the overall look and feel of the webpage, and would have better organized scripts so that all my API functionality was seperated from the main React component.
