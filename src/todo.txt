Instructions: 

We would like to look at a webpage that shows:

Prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum from two (any) different exchanges/sources. 
Differentiate buy and sell price clearly 
Recommendations on which exchange one should buy and/or sell.
Recommend where to buy and where to sell. Each of the recommendation can be a different exchange

Deliverables:

Link to github with the code
Detailed instructions on how to build and run
Answers to below Questionnaire ( included as a markdown file in GH repo)
For bonus points, provide a link to live version of the solution
 

Other info that is useful for doing the exercise:

If BTC is 10000$ to buy on Exchange A and 10050$ to buy on Exchange B, you would recommend to buy on Exchange A. 
Any front end technology is fine. We use React
Any backend technology is fine. We use spring boot/java 
You can pick any exchange for pricing. If exchange price is unavailable, use price from any service provider such as blockchain.com
Your webpage is not hard coding the prices. It should talk to its own backend to fetch the prices. And that backend fetches prices from other exchanges/service providers
